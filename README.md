Welcome to the C# OOP - June 2023 course repository! In this course, participants will learn the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), how to work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The course will cover fundamental OOP principles such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Participants will delve into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns). SOLID principles for object-oriented software design will be introduced. Various debugging techniques will be explored, and participants will learn how to create and use decorators. The course will emphasize component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
